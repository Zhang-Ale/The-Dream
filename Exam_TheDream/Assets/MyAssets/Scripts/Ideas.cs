     * Theme: What do we do now?
     * The 2 diversifiers
     * 1. Mind over matter: add a voice over narration to the gameplay
     * 2. My eyes are my ears: all sounds must be visualized in some form. This game shouldn't 
     * provide any less informational feedback to a player that would normally be able to hear
     
     * Ideas:  
     1. Add a hole in the wall, use the gun to grab an object and put that object in the wall to open the door.
     2. Make a rover target, shoot the middle with gun to open the door
     3. Have a box and its topside can be removed and used as an inclined ladder, make the textures are fit
     4. Can remove the front surface of a box to show the way down 
     5. If trigger hits the door opens only for a second and player can't reach there in time
     6. Enter through a portal which is in another dimension
     7. Insert the portal in an object target that can be resized
     8. Add loading scene when passing through portal to the next level 
     9. Add some random spaces for player to explore
     10. Make some rooms that are set gravitationally inverted
